# get_something_from_netlfow
First, i am sorry about some chinese comments in src if you are not chinese!

This script can get something from data of type of netflow in periods!
It need two paramenters, one is start of time, another is end of time

In this part, i get something what i need with shell in ubuntu, which combines cmds of nfdump, awk, date and so on.
Secondï¼Œthey can work well in situatinos of mine. 
Last but not least, if you find any errors in them , please connact me via 220174285@seu.edu.cn! Thanks for reading!
