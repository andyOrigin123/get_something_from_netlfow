get somethin from netflow with shell
First, i am sorry about some chinese comments in src if you are not chinese!

This script can get something from data of type of netflow in periods!

In this part, i get something what i need with shell in ubuntu, which combines cmds of nfdump, awk, date and so on.
It need two paramenters, one is start of time, another is end of time
